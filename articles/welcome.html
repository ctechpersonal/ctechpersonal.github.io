   <p>Here I'm going to be writing whatever I want, whenever I want, out of my topics of interest. Broad categories include:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>Physiology, Physiological Chemistry (from details to the practical implication of the knowledge), also includes real (non-fake) medical studies and analysis of their data.</li>

      <li>Powerful every day (or at least could be such) tools like Math, Programing (particularly including Neural Networks) and web-related like Search Engines (get to be found rather than get to find; marketing angle (SEO) as well as technical) and others.</li>

      <li>Meaningful Learning and Education; I interested in all Nature explaining topics as well as Engineering as a way to use that knowledge for creating new useful tools.</li>

      <li>Economics and Finance.</li>

      <li>Last but not least: general attitude; self responsibility; getting things done; luck; faith and beliefs; emotions management; successes; etc.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>I enjoy consuming video or even audio educational content, so I plan to create more of it myself. I combine video or audio content with text whenever I find it appropriate.</p>

   <p>I have an academic degree, but think of self education as the only form of effective and useful education.</p>

   <p>Currently I work as Search Engine (Google) Optimizer through direct contacts as well as on UpWork. If you're reading this and interested in my services, you're weocome to visit the <a href="contact.html">Contacts</a> page.</p>
